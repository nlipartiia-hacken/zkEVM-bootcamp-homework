##  Arkworks example

[This](https://github.com/nlipartiia-hacken/arkworks-example/tree/master) repo contains a program that uses Arkworks library to implements several simple checks, such as:

- 1 + 1 = 2;

- the multiplicative inverse of the field element multiplied by itself equals to one;

- A number (field element) raised to the power of the prime field modulus is equal to itself (the Euler-Fermat theorem).
